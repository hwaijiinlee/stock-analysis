# Overview of Stock Analysis Project
After having written a VBA code to perform analyses for Steve of multiple stocksâ€™ performances over two years, Steve was keen to expand the analyses to include entire stock markets over multiple years. Due to the large increase in the number of stocks to analyze, the existing VBA code could take too long to run.

The purpose of this project is therefore to re-look at the existing VBA code and refactor it so that it can churn out the analyses over large number of stocks more efficiently.

We will also review the stock performance of the existing dataset for 2017 and 2018 to determine how they have done during those two years.
